<h2>Fox Food Hunt</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's a twist on the Phaser Tutorial game.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It uses simple game physics to move the fox and also randomly generates food from a sprite sheet.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I mainly learned how to get my first game up and running, it is very similar to the First Game tutorial on Phaser
but I learned how to use my own assets and generate random elements. The hardest part was getting the correct sizes
to use for the sprites.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bakudas.itch.io/generic-rpg-pack">Fox Sprite</a></li>
<li><a href="https://edermunizz.itch.io/free-pixel-art-hill">Background</a></li>
<li><a href="https://henrysoftware.itch.io/pixel-food">Food</a></li>
<li><a href="https://phaser.io/content/tutorials/coding-tips-004/cloud-platform.png">Clouds</a></li>
<li><a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-2-game">Ground platform</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It closely resembles the Phaser Tutorial game.
<ul>
<li>I used code from the Tutorial Game: <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-2-game">Making Your First Game</a></li>
<li>Also from code from here: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/group-vs-group">Group vs Group</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Fox Food Hunt is a cute simple game where various foods are spread across the screen and you must collect, or rather eat them all.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
There is not really a theme, it's a fox collecting different types of food.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For my input I used the arrow keys to move. For the randomness I used Math.random to generate a number between 0 and 500 to determine which food from the sprite sheet to use. This game is a platformer.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The mechanics include sprite movement/jumping and also item collectment.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to enjoy a cute and simple platformer game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player game move the fox to the left with the left arrow and to the right with the right arrow. The fox can jump using the up arrow, and can also jump on top of cloud platforms (but not through the platforms). By walking into the food the players can collect it for 5 points a piece. The goal is to collect all the food in the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The players can use the cloud platforms to get food in places they can not reach by just simply jumping from the ground.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set place in a small hilly-type forest with a fox as the protagonist. The fox is very hungry, and has found a spot in the forest where there is a bunch of food! Thus the fox decides to try to eat them all.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is simple enough it can be played by anyone.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1 to 2 minutes.
</li>
